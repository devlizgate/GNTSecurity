                    <p>High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is a proprietary audio/video interface for transmitting uncompressed video data and compressed or uncompressed digital audio data from an HDMI-compliant source device to a compatible computer monitor, video projector, digital television, or digital audio device.</p>

                    <p>DisplayPort is a digital display interface developed by a consortium of PC and chip manufacturers. It is primarily used to connect a video source to a display device such as a computer monitor, and it can also carry audio, USB, and other forms of data.</p>

                    <h3>VGA</h3>

                    <p>Video Graphics Array (VGA) is a standard connector used for computer video output. VGA connectors and cables carry analog signals, which can limit the display resolution and image quality compared to digital connections.</p>

                    <p>Digital Visual Interface (DVI) is a video display interface developed to transmit uncompressed digital video. DVI can be configured to support multiple modes such as DVI-A (analog only), DVI-D (digital only), and DVI-I (digital and analog).</p>

        <section class="resolution">
            <h2>Understanding Resolution and DPI</h2>
            <p>Resolution refers to the number of pixels that make up the display image, usually denoted as width x height (e.g., 1920x1080). Higher resolutions mean more pixels, resulting in sharper and clearer images.</p>
            <p>DPI (Dots Per Inch) indicates the pixel density of a display. Higher DPI values mean higher pixel density, which translates to better image quality, especially on smaller screens.</p>

            <h2>Tips for Choosing the Right Monitor</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Consider the purpose: Determine if you need a monitor for gaming, professional work, or general use.</li>
                <li>Check compatibility: Ensure the monitor's connectors match your computer's output ports.</li>
                <li>Look for adjustable stands: Monitors with adjustable stands provide better ergonomics and comfort.</li>
                <li>Check reviews and ratings: Look for user reviews and expert ratings to make an informed decision.</li>
